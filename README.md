# ShuttleCP: Jog Dial for ChiliPeppr

This code is meant to allow button, jog, and shuttle events from a Contour ShuttleXpress controller to flow to the Serial Port JSON server typically used with ChiliPeppr driven CNC machines. It was originally developed to run on a RaspberryPi but could probably run on any linux box.

Interface to Shuttle Contour Xpress based on "Contour ShuttlePro v2 interface" by Eric Messick.
